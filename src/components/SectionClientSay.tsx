      "I’m settled in very well now to the long-term rental apartment that Vacation Saga in particular helped me find. I found the traditional agents mostly very unresponsive (or rude) and online advertisements were often not up to date or duplicated by several agencies. Vacation Saga actually understood what to do. Their online agent sent me many photos of available properties, honed these for price and requirements, and the on-the-ground agent met me to show me around (and meet the owner when s/he was free). All properties I visited were owned by Greek nationals (as I wanted), who, like me, had decided to avoid traditional agents. All the paperwork was done in person with the owner and with lawyers. When I said I’d prefer not to send documents to go to the owner through Vacation Saga, Abhay completely understood and we arranged an in-person meet with the owner. It’s best to think of Vacation Saga for long-term rentals as an introduction agency, like traditional agencies, but one that, for a change, does its job extremely well. I didn’t find a property that was too expensive. For the charge and the work involved, I got really good value and have already recommended the company to friends.",
